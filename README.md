# RSL_Upgrade_Calculator
Calculator for RAID: Shadow Legends to determine how many 2 star champions are required to upgrade one champion to 6 star.

## About
While playing RAID: Shadow Legends, upgrading champions to higher levels is essential to making progress in the game.  How many more resources are needed to get to the desired 6 star champion though?  I found myself making this calculation by hand over... and over... and over... for every champion that I was trying to upgrade.  There must be a better way!!!

Enter the RSL Upgrade Calculator.  No longer do I need to make these repetitive calculations to figure out how much farther I have to reach the goal. Now, by simply entering how many 'food' champions I have at each level, I instantly know how many more 2 star champions are required without the need to make a manual calculation.

## How it Works
1. Run the program.
2. Answer each of the 4 prompts with an integer. Non-integer answers will produce an error and the question will be repeated.
    - How many 2 star champions will be fed?
    - How many 3 star champions will be fed?
    - How many 4 star champions will be fed?
    - How many 5 star champions will be fed?
3. The result is calculated and presented.
    - You need XX more 2 star champions to make a 6 star champion.
    - OR
    - Congratulations! You have enough food to upgrade a champion to 6 star!

## Assumptions
1. The desired champion to be upgraded to 6 star is currently at 5 star level 50.
2. Only the number of champions required to make the upgrade is included in the calculation.  Additional resources to level up 'food' champions is not included.
3. Available chickens are not included in the calculation.  However, chickens can be accounted for by including them in the 'champions to be fed' prompts.
